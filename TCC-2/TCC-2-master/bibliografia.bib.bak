  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the design of Virtual-Learning Content Management System to be used by students and instructors a like using problem-based learning (PBL) as the instructional methodology. V-LCMS is designed and implemented at Mara Professional College Indera Mahkota (MPCIM). It details the rationale for implementing V-LCMS as well as reporting the intended learning outcomes by assessing the students' achievements. The achievement is reported as a case study conducted in an undergraduate level course. The students participated in this V-LCMS case study tests are correlated with their achievement of the course's learning objectives. The paper focuses on the uploading of the notes and assessments easily and quickly, and also easing the interactions between the instructors and the students. In addition, the system also aims to develop a web site using Interactive and Incremental Development (IDD) prototype. To develop this system, the software chosen is Joomla 1.5, Windows XP as an operating system, PHP 5.2.5 as a programming language, MySQL 5.0 as a database and Apache 2.2.8 as a web server. Other advantage of this V-LCMS is it makes it easier for the students to interact with instructors using forum or chat room. The PBL was implemented using the interaction between students and lecturers using both facilities, i.e. forum and chat room. Overall, not only the system facilitates the instructors, but also it facilitates their students in terms of receiving the knowledge imparted.},

This change is captured via space and airborne remote sensing, in-situ measurement, and climate modeling. Those observations and simulations record data in myriad formats across a number of pertinent data archives funded by NSF, NASA, NOAA, and other federal agencies. Simply finding data may be hard, but we restrict our focus in this paper to the subject of what to do with the data (and metadata) once it is found - the "complexity" portion of the Big Data challenge. We present our current efforts for dealing with the complexity and heterogeneity of Arctic and Antarctic data - Apache Tika. Apache Tika is an open source framework for metadata exploration, automatic text mining, and information retrieval of 1200 of the most widely used data file formats and 20 rich metadata models to go along with those formats. Our current research efforts are targeted at expanding Apache Tika to parse, extract, and analyze common data formats used in Artie and Antarctic research making them more easily accessible, searchable, and retrievable by all major content management systems (Plone, Drupal, Alfresco, etc.). Furthermore, expanding Tika to handle common Polar data formats will also naturally invite the technology/open source community to deal with Polar use cases, helping to draw attention to and increase understanding of these remote regions.},

The amount of used multimedia has increased automatically several times. Effective management and security of multimedia content is current issue, because it is no rarity to manage and share terabytes of multimedia content on websites nowadays. This paper deals with the proposal of model, which would meet demanding requirements for efficient and safe management of large amounts of media content on the websites. The first step is to analyse existing solutions, compare their features and functions. Nowadays, there are several well-known portal solutions for viewing, sharing, cataloguing and managing of the media content that stand at the forefront of their use thanks to their specific functions and uniqueness. The second step is to analyse the ability to manage content and files and their security in content management system (CMS). The final solution is connection of first and second steps into one unit and creation a model to optimize security and management of multimedia content in CMS Drupal. Results of work are supported by creating a functional prototype of website, which was created during a research phase of this article.},

  Abstract                 = {Many open source software systems are variability-intensive because they are frequently adapted to different customer needs or deployment environments. Variability in these systems not only occurs in functionality, but also in quality attributes (e.g., security, reliability, dependability). Furthermore, variability in functionality and variability in quality attributes affect each other. Recently, open source communities have adopted microblogging to document and share software engineering knowledge. Microblogging dissolves boundaries between developers and other stakeholders (e.g., end users). This facilitates the involvement of many different non-technical stakeholders in the software development process. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and suitability of utilizing microblogs to identify and analyze dependability information about open source software systems. We use the example of the currently most popular microblogging infrastructure (Twitter) and a widely used open source content management system (Drupal). Our results indicate that even though open source communities frequently share information on Twitter, challenges exist for extracting and analyzing dependability information. Furthermore, a better understanding is needed to describe the relation between issues reported by user communities in microblogs, and issues and actions documented by developer communities in change logs and release information.},

The proposed framework embeds multiple entry channels for different target groups and motivations to re-use, report, comment and share content. The implementation is built on top of a Content Management System. In this approach we are using Drupal but any other CMS can be used alternatively. Even though in our paradigm the sources are mainly from an institution's data, namely National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) digital library, the utilization of the proposed architecture can be directly extended to additional fields.},

  Abstract                 = {A web content management system (Web CMS) has been developed to host a corpus of 405 folk songs for media sharing. It is based on Drupal 7. Exploring various modules, the system offers multiple functionalities, including user registration, layered information about each song in different pages, similar content search, friendship relationships between the registered users, favorite lists, etc. Users can visit song pages, listen to the songs, and provide feedback. In addition to the Web CMS, a game with a purpose (GWAP), called Erasitechnis GWAP, has been designed and deployed on Facebook as an enjoyable way encouraging users to enroll and provide music annotations. Erasitechnis GWAP is a combined approach of existing games with a purpose, which focuses on tagging Greek folk music promoting less frequent tags. By doing so, descriptive tags are collected enabling the creation of a fully annotated dataset, which is exploited to train recommendation or autotagging systems.},

  Abstract                 = {My-Plant.org (My-Plant) is a social networking portal for the Plant Sciences community. As part of the iPlant Collaborative, My-Plant is charged with the goal of bringing together scientists, students, educators, and other interested parties by providing a new approach to connecting with others in the plant sciences thereby helping to spark new collaborations and communication among them. Many social networking sites exist where users can form groups and communicate, but the group structure is flat and has no inherent interconnectivity. My-Plant connects users via branches (called clades) of the phylogenetic tree of green plants, thus creating a unique, phylogenetically based social network structure. My-Plant users can join clades at any level of the tree and collaborate with other users interested in these clades. My-Plant is built upon the Drupal open source content management system. This paper discusses My-Plant in detail, its concept and contributions to the iPlant Collaborative, its implementation details, and its efforts to become an information hub for the plant sciences community. In addition, the paper focuses on some of the technology challenges, lessons learned, and future work of My-Plant.},

  Abstract                 = {E-commerce is very efficient and effective, but it needs programming knowledge to create and manage. Many small organizations do not have human resource for this task and cannot support cost for hiring programmers. Thus, many application providers create content management system applications to enable the e-commerce website to be created and managed through friendly user interface. However, existing content management system applications for e-commerce is lack of real-time communication feature, even it is an important feature for e-commerce. Although e-commerce feature can be manually coded and added, lack of programming knowledge problem occurs. Therefore, this project solve this problem by designing and developing content management system for ecommerce which concentrated on real-time communication feature using instant messaging and short message sending. It covers e-commerce feature and content management system feature. The system is divided into two styles, front office and back office style and seven subsystems. It is developed using HTMP, CSS, and PHP language along with Ajax technique. This system is tested by ten subjects.},

The main advantage in using a CMS is that the contents to can be segregated from the design for the application. The content goes to database and design, in the form of template is stored in CSS. Availability of free design templates makes a CMS more attractive. There are many advantages of using a cms including rapid deployment, lower maintenance cost, flexible architecture, large community support and above and free and open source, which can be customized as per requirements. However these advantages comes at a price. And this price includes susceptibility to security issues. According to Javelin Strategy \& Research, 11.1 million adults were victims of identity theft in 2009, for a total fraud amount of \$54 billion. With security at the forefront of your mind, remember that an open source system is just that...open to everyone. The FOSS based CMS includes vulnerability to file inclusion, Cross site scripting, gain privileges, sql injections, misconfiguration, unsecured storage, invalidated redirects. The presentation discusses these security issues and ways to avoid them.},

In the framework, the interaction policy for the involved agents is based on combination technique which combined the push and pull mechanisms. The agentbased framework consists of four agents: search agent, priority agent, notify agent and download agents that are applied in the e-learning domain. To demonstrate the working of these agents within the e-learning domain, three scenarios with different level of complexity involving one course/subject are presented. In general, these agents assist the students to get prompt notifications every time new documents are available in the course registered. Thus, eliminating the students from not knowing that new documents have been uploaded by the lecturers. Moodle, the e-learning domain is chosen since Moodle is an open-source Content Management System that encourages any developers to contribute new enhancement of the existing feature or create the new features for the benefits of Moodle users.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of the enterprises are using web application for communicating with their customers, partners, shareholders and others. Additionally the web applications are used to carry out commercial activities and business transactions. As web applications are extensively used, its operating environment plays an important role which determines its efficiency. Nowadays cloud has proved to be one of the best operating environments for deploying web applications because of its features like automatic load balancing, scalability, maintenance and cost. As the demand is increasing for cloud computing, many organizations are looking for cloud based software to reduce their deployment cost and server maintenance overhead. The existing web application like individual/corporate websites, CRM/ERP applications, E-Publishing, E-Government, E-Commerce and E-Learning are slowly migrating to cloud. On the other hand managing the content of such web applications is a tedious task. The Content Management Systems (CMS) has already proved to be a good choice for developing web applications which ensures rapid application development and ease of use. CMS allows even a non-technical user to create, edit, manage and publish the content easily. When CMS is coupled with cloud the resultant application is highly efficient and easily manageable. In this paper we have proposed a new technique to develop cloud based software using content management systems.},

Moreover, LearnSquare is compatible with SCORM standard, so the system supports reusable content within this standard. The results from the survey of user satisfaction have shown that about 70 percents of users are very satisfied and most satisfied with the system. Furthermore, LearnSquare successfully supports the expansion of education to rural areas in order to open up opportunity in education for most students.},

Their integration in Content and Learning Management Systems (CMSs or LMSs) has been an active research topic for years, supporting mainly ad hoc solutions. A notable exception has been the use of federation protocols -commonly used for sharing laboratories from one university to other-, for actually sharing laboratories from a remote laboratory system to a C/LMS. This approach opened new doors in the simplification of the process, since it did not require the remote laboratories to make any type of change. The focus of this contribution is to provide a solution to decrease the number of functionalities required for creating an integration by providing a software component that reuses them. As shown in the contribution, this component has been implemented and two remote laboratory management systems (which provide access to multiple remote laboratories) are already supported, and a third one is under development. In the C/LMS side, all the LMSs supporting IMS LTI are supported, and HTTP APIs are provided for being supported by other systems. Indeed, the contribution describes its support in the Joomla CMS and in the Moodle 1.9 and dotLRN LMSs which do not support IMS LTI. The solution, called gateway4labs, is an open source initiative which targets to be used in production.},

Federations of remote laboratories have existed for years: they are based on enabling two universities to exchange remote laboratories directly, without registering students of the latter on the former university. Integration of remote laboratories on Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Content Management Systems (CMS) have also been addressed in the past, enabling institutions to delegate the authentication or authorization of the experiments to the LMS/CMS. However, these integrations are usually achieved in an ad hoc way, integrating each particular laboratory to a LMS/CMS. This contribution studies the use of federation models to integrate remote laboratory management systems in LMS/CMSs, since both approaches (integrating a laboratory on an a external electronic learning tool, and integrating a laboratory on other laboratory) are essentially equivalent. The contribution defines two case studies to evaluate this approach, showing how this integration is achieved on a LMS (Moodle) and on a CMS (Joomla).},

  Abstract                 = {Internet has become priceless tool that enables corporate world to show their capabilities. While Web applications have gained importance on the Internet, security is the only thing to worry. Business data is very critical that floats on the cloud and that's why Web Application Security is rapidly becoming a growing concern for all enterprises. In this paper we tried to show what is Hacking and its symptoms. In web development Content Management System (CMS) is gaining so much popularity as it uses to make easy editing and publishing process for novice even if he doesn't know web programming. There are over thousand of open source CMS available in the market. When we just talk about content management concept two or three names like Joomla, Drupal and WordPress strike in mind. As these are the one of the best CMSs in the market and their community provides nice basic security still we want to compare these CMS and want to know which CMS provides best security. To do the comparison we have done two case studies. In case 1 we have developed one common page in all CMS and host it then after we have applied different web attacks like SQLi, XSS, CSRF etc. and derived their hacking results. In case 2 we used Acunetix WVS Reporter v6.0 to find out the strength of security in different CMS. Apart from this we also try to find out Broken links in all listed CMSs.},

It not only offers services but also enhances scholarly communication and research among the patrons of the library. This paper describes the portal of Space Applications Centre (SAC) Library at ISRO, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and designed using Joomla: A Content Management System (CMS). An attempt has been made here to explain the various services provided through this portal to the ISRO/DOS users so that they can become effective information seekers and evaluate information efficiently and effectively. It also highlights how it tries to meet user expectations of information on demand as well as in anticipation.},

  Abstract                 = {PJ-SQL-Browser is a free Python-Javascript web based tool. It relies on jQuery and python libraries, and is intended to provide the CMS software framework a real-time handle to the DB backend inside a local web browser. Nowadays, the number of DBs accessing built on Java or .Net is steadingly increasing. However, many of these application have several drawbacks: usually they are not open-source, they provide interface only with a specific kind of database, are platform-dependent and very CPU and memory consuming, so that normal computers can have problems to run them. We developed a template-based free software tool, intended to handle with different DBMS by using a local Web Browser. Such tool makes use of jQuery and python libraries and we hereby prove to be fast, easy to install and to configure. Thanks to JavaScript Interpreter, a powerful Javascript engine implemented in the latest web browsers (Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer), and to the easier JavaScript-HTML interaction enabled by jQuery libraries, such tool performs backend-databases-access and provides all the features embedded in commercial DB clients like DDL statements and allows data exportation to various formats (like XML and JSON), that can be employed eventually exploited by other applications. On top at that the application enables as well updates real time; indeed by using asynchronous Ajax calls to server services, we can keep users updated with the latest information changed on Online Database Condition, ensuring a small latency to retrieve the real-time information. Finally, by using a set of pre-defined functions, users are allowed to create their customized views for a better data visualisation.},

These technologies complement formal means of sharing knowledge via conferences and published papers, where it is impossible to share all the research details, and where negative results are rarely included. A small but growing number of scientists and researchers are beginning to harness these Web 2.0 technologies as a transformative way of doing science. With the advent of service oriented architectures, the model of chaining services to create analysis workflows provides the research community unprecedented opportunity to collaborate, sharing their workflows with one another, reproducing and analyzing research results, and leveraging colleagues' expertise to expedite the process of scientific knowledge discovery. A crucial component needed for this unprecedented level of cooperation within the research community is a reusable, extensible and customizable environment for building collaborative Ã‚Â¿open scienceÃ‚Â¿ portals for managing these shared analysis workflows. This paper describes the design and the development of Talkoot, a customizable Ã‚Â¿software applianceÃ‚Â¿ to build collaborative portals for earth science services and analysis workflows.},

This full Web based authoring tool is based on an object-oriented programming framework (Zope) and implements both native and customized features of a content management product (Plone). The system handles a core component, called a lesson. It allows teachers to aggregate single resources (documents, quiz, glossary term...). It provides students with a consistent and structured view of the content of a lesson. The Web based platform was initially developed to meet specific needs of the medicine campus. It has been extended to support the whole publishing process of pedagogical resources in the university. Its integration in the university information system is partly achieved with single sign on features (CAS authentication). Access to a centralized description of curricula still remains to enhance: it depends on an institutional reviewing of the database according to the policies of License, Master, and Doctorate schema. A multidisciplinary configuration of the platform is available, allowing students and teachers to be involved in several courses handled by a same instance of Zope / Plone.},

Using the QR codes is one of the most intriguing ways of digitally connecting consumers to the internet via mobile phones since the mobile phones have become a basic necessity thing of everyone. In this paper, we present a methodology for creating QR codes by which the users enter text into a web browser and get the QR code generated. Drupal module was used in conjunction with the popular libqrencode C library to develop user interface on the web browser and encode data in a QR Code symbol. The experiment was conducted using single and multiple lines of text in both English and Thai languages. The result shows that all QR encoding outputs were successfully and correctly generated.},

  Abstract                 = {As more engineered nanomaterials (eNM) are developed for a wide range of applications, it is crucial to minimize any unintended environmental impacts resulting from the application of eNM. To realize this vision, industry and policymakers must base risk management decisions on sound scientific information about the environmental fate of eNM, their availability to receptor organisms (e.g., uptake), and any resultant biological effects (e.g. toxicity). To address this critical need, we propose a model driven data mining system, called NEIMiner, for studying nanomaterial environmental impact (NEI). NEIMiner consists of four components: NEI modeling framework data integration, data management and access, and model discovery and composition. The NEI modeling framework defines the scope of NEI modeling and the strategy of integrating NEI models to form a layered, comprehensive predictability. The data integration layer brings together heterogeneous data sources related to NEI via automatic web services and web scraping technologies. The data management and access layer reuses and extends a popular Content Management System (CMS), Drupal, and consists of modules that model the complex data structure for NEI related bibliography and characterization data. The model discovery and composition layer provides an advanced analysis capability for NEI data. Together, these components provide significant value to the process of aggregating and analyzing large-scale distributed NEI data. A prototype of the NEIMiner system is available at http://neiminer.i-a-i.com/.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a case-control study to identify risk factors that are associated with higher rates of webserver compromise. We inspect a random sample of around 200 000 webservers and automatically identify attributes hypothesized to affect the susceptibility to compromise, notably content management system (CMS) and webserver type. We then cross-list this information with data on webservers hacked to serve phishing pages or redirect to unlicensed online pharmacies. We find that webservers running WordPress and Joomla are more likely to be hacked than those not running any CMS, and that servers running Apache and Nginx are more likely to be hacked than those running Microsoft IIS. We also identify several WordPress plugins and Joomla extensions that associated with compromise. Furthermore, using a series of logistic regressions, we find that a CMSâ€™s market share is positively correlated with website compromise. Surprisingly, we find that webservers running outdated software are less likely to be compromised than those running up-to date software. We present evidence that this is true for core WordPress software (the most popular CMS platform) and many associated plugins. Finally, we examine what happens to webservers following compromise. We find that under 5\% of hacked WordPress websites are subsequently updated, but those that do are recompromised about half as often as those that do not update.},

The trends of Internet development and the popularity of World Wide Web have changed the business models of global enterprises, and the importance of CMS has increased dramatically in recent years, but the open source CMS is usually criticized for the lack of applications in manufacturing fields. This study creates a Web-based PDM system with open source CMS providing the Internet computer-aided design environment for the information creating, sharing, and managing in the product design/manufacturing phases. With the flexibility features of open source CMS, the further PDM functions can be installed, modified or developed.},
